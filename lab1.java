//this commit is made this way because i could not install the program needed for this course cause my application for the student pacage was declined. 

/*tasks
1. Create a program that prints your name to the screen. The program output should resemble the following:

2. Create a program that prints out the following:

3. Create a program that counts and displays how many seconds there are in a year. You can assume that a year consists of 365 days (therefore the year is not a leap year). 

4. Create a program that asks the user for two integers and then prints their sum. 

5. Create a program that asks the user for a number and tells if the number is positive (i.e. greater than zero).

6. Create a program that asks the user for two numbers and prints the greater of those two. The program should also handle the case in which the two numbers are equal.
